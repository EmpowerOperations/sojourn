//! SSCCE: `repair` lands a point on a vertex with residuals of -1e-15, one rounding error inside.
//!
//! Found by Artemis's `e03-spring-3` benchmark on 2026-09-11. Drop into `tests/` of the sojourn
//! crate (branch `v0-artemis`) and run `cargo nextest run --test repair_lands_too_close_at_a_vertex`.
//!
//! The tension/compression spring (Arora 1989 via Coello 2000): `d` wire diameter, `D` coil
//! diameter, `N` active coils, four constraints. Its optimum is a VERTEX where the deflection
//! constraint and the shear-stress constraint are both active. `repair` of a point just outside
//! that vertex comes back with both residuals at about `-1e-15`: feasible, but by less than the
//! rounding of a single arithmetic operation on the coordinates.
//!
//! Artemis stores points normalized to `[-1, 1]` per coordinate and hands the evaluator the
//! denormalized value: `x -> lo + (((x - lo) / (hi - lo) * 2 - 1) + 1) / 2 * (hi - lo)`. That
//! round trip is exact for most values and one ulp off for some. One ulp on `d` moves the two
//! residuals by about `1e-8` (`d` appears as `d^4` in a term of order `1e5`), which is seven
//! orders of magnitude more than the margin `repair` left. So the point Artemis evaluates is
//! infeasible by its own oracle, and its wrapper has to walk the point back in.
//!
//! The contract (Artemis's design note, contract 1) asks for *strictly* feasible with "a final
//! deliberate step inward". A margin of a few ulps of the coordinate is not that step at a
//! vertex: it has to be measured in the residual, not in the coordinate, or it has to be large
//! enough that any one-ulp perturbation of the point stays feasible.
//!
//! Observed (first test): `repair` of the vertex point returns it with the shear residual at
//! exactly -2.2e-16 -- one ulp inside -- and the frame round trip puts it at +2.9e-15.
//! Expected: a margin that survives one-ulp perturbation of the coordinates. The second test
//! shows the margin IS sufficient one step away from the vertex (it passes today); the defect is
//! specific to the landing where two constraints are active at once.
