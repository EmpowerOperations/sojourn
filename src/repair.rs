//! A feasible point near a given one, deterministically.
//!
//! Reached as [`FeasibleRegion::repair`](crate::FeasibleRegion::repair), which
//! carries the contract; this module is the algorithm, over a
//! `&ConstraintSystem`. It lives on the solved region rather than on the
//! system because a region that could not be solved has nothing to repair
//! toward, and because a caller with a region in hand is the only one who
//! ever asks.
//!
//! The consumer is an optimizer that cannot evaluate its objective at an
//! infeasible point — the constraints encode things like mesh validity, and a
//! bad point is a crashed solver rather than a bad number. Every point it
//! proposes that fails the constraints comes here, thousands of times a run,
//! and must come back feasible by the same oracle the search uses, near where
//! it wanted to be, and the same every time it is asked. The contract and the
//! alternatives it displaced are written up in `docs/todo.md` under *Repair
//! for Artemis*; this is the shape that survived.
//!
//! # The stages, and the order they run in
//!
//! Every stage that lands hands its point to an aggregator; the nearest with
//! the clearance wins, released first (a coordinate reverted to the caller's
//! value can only come nearer). "Nearest" is Euclidean over box-normalised
//! coordinates — the consumer's metric, and human intuition's; the taxicab
//! metric an earlier design measured in preferred a landing that moved one
//! coordinate over a nearer one that moved two, an axis bias an optimizer
//! must not be fed. The stages, cheapest and most exact first:
//!
//! **Clamp** — where cheap. Each coordinate has a conditional slice, the
//! interval it may occupy with the others held ([`interval::slice`]);
//! clamping into it is the axis projection onto that coordinate's
//! constraints. A slice narrows against every constraint naming the
//! coordinate, so the clamp costs a walk of each such constraint's tree per
//! coordinate per sweep — cheap where constraints are local
//! ([`CLAMP_LOCAL`]), and skipped where one is dense (the beam's deflection
//! names two hundred), which is also where no single-coordinate clamp could
//! land. Where the moved coordinates are *separable* — every constraint
//! naming one names it alone, as bounds do — the axis move is the exact
//! Euclidean projection and is returned outright, on the bound at zero
//! clearance (Artemis measured coordinates *at* a bound as more accurate).
//! Otherwise the landing is a candidate and its reach the derivative-free
//! solve's start.
//!
//! **Newton** — the projection, from the point. Newton on the KKT system
//! over the active set ([`newton::nearest`]), with the gradients the tape's
//! reverse sweep provides: exact in one step on a linear constraint, a few
//! on a curved one, microseconds at fifty variables. It declines where a
//! constraint that bites has no derivative or the iteration will not
//! converge. A clear landing here is the answer — the aggregator returns
//! before the derivative-free stages run at all, so the smooth case pays
//! only Newton. The landing depends on the constraints and the point and on
//! nothing else, which is the property the consumer needs and the one an
//! earlier design lacked: it chorded from *anchors* the caller supplied, so
//! every landing was dragged toward the census — a disc corner at 45° landed
//! at 17°, where a projection lands it at 45°.
//!
//! **Sample and the derivative-free solve** — off the smooth path, where
//! Newton declined: a jump (`floor`, `%`, `sgn`) or a curvature Newton could
//! not settle. The sampling box first — uniform draws around the point,
//! driven coordinates on their surfaces, the box doubled while empty and
//! shrunk onto the nearest hit, then a chord from that hit — because it
//! needs no slice, gradient or continuity, only a region fat enough to
//! sample over its free coordinates, which is what a jump leaves. Then
//! COBYLA ([`local::nearest`]), where the box found nothing *or* the
//! dimension is small ([`COBYLA_CHEAP`]): the box shrinks onto the first
//! branch it meets and can miss a nearer one on a thin many-branched region
//! (`(x+2)(x-1) == 0`), where COBYLA's linear models on a smooth constraint
//! do not, and there it is cheap; past a handful of dimensions the regions
//! that reach here are fat ones the box handles and COBYLA is the last
//! resort, `O(d²m)` an iteration. The box across a jump: 0.40 of the box
//! from the proposal became the nearest cell (`tests/cvg_repair.rs`, the ball
//! oracle across a jump).
//!
//! **Reference** — nothing feasible seen at all: a constraint flat where the
//! point stands (Keane's `0.75 − ∏xᵢ` with a coordinate at `1e-11` is `0.75`
//! to fifty digits every way), which no slice, model or box around the point
//! reads. A feasible point to walk *in* from, from [`local::find_initial`]
//! under a fixed seed — a function of the system, not of what the region
//! sampled — a chord bisected from it to the point, and the projection from
//! that landing, where the constraint is well-scaled again; so the reference
//! decides only which basin, never where in it. `Stranded` means this found
//! nothing either.
//!
//! A boundary landing — a chord's, or a Newton one — is stepped inside by
//! [`stepped_inside`] / [`off_the_boundary`]: along the inward direction in
//! hand (Newton's wedge bisector, or the chord's own), and failing that the
//! clamp, in doublings of the clearance until the oracle passes.
//!
//! # Clearance: a deliberate step inside, not an ulp
//!
//! The caller stores points normalised to a unit cube and denormalises them
//! before evaluating. That round trip is one ulp off for some values, and one
//! ulp on a coordinate can move a residual by `1e-8` when the coordinate enters
//! a term at the fourth power. A landing a few ulps inside a bound — which is
//! what the ladder alone produces — is feasible here and infeasible by the
//! time the caller looks at it. Found at a vertex of the tension spring, where two constraints
//! are active at once; `tests/regression_fixture.rs` keeps the case.
//!
//! So `repair` takes a **clearance**: a fraction of each variable's box width
//! that the answer keeps between itself and every wall, in every coordinate
//! direction. One scalar, but `clearance * width` on each coordinate, which is
//! the per-axis tolerance the box's own scale implies, in the unit cube the
//! caller normalises into and the metric this module measures distance in. A
//! point *has* the clearance when it is feasible and so are its `2d` axis
//! neighbours at that distance — [`ConstraintSystem::is_feasible`] with the
//! clearance, which judges each constraint at the point and along each
//! variable it names — which is exactly "survives any per-coordinate
//! perturbation smaller than the step", and on a convex region is the whole
//! L1 ball of that radius.
//!
//! The oracle judges; the slices construct. A clamp lands inside the slice
//! shrunk by the step at each end, and a slice is an outer enclosure, so
//! "inside the shrunk slice" is where to aim and never a proof. A point that
//! truly has the clearance sits inside every shrunk slice, though, so the clamp
//! never moves a point that already qualifies. Where a slice is narrower than
//! twice the step the clamp aims for its middle, and if nothing reached has the
//! clearance the answer is [`RepairError::Cramped`] with the nearest feasible
//! point in it: the region is thinner than the caller's own noise floor, and
//! saying so beats handing back a point that will fail on the next look.
//!
//! # The metric is Euclidean over box-normalised coordinates
//!
//! Normalised, because the caller thinks in a unit cube and "near" in metres
//! and pascals at once means nothing. Euclidean, because that is the
//! consumer's question and human intuition's: the taxicab metric this used to
//! measure in prefers any landing that touches one coordinate over a nearer
//! one that touches two, which is a bias toward the axes an optimizer should
//! not be fed. Taxicab was chosen for ranking anchors, where the contrast
//! between nearest and farthest neighbour collapses in high dimension and
//! collapses fastest for the higher norms (Aggarwal, Hinneburg & Keim, 2001);
//! the anchors are gone and the argument went with them. Candidates are
//! ranked, the consolation chosen and the back-off's unit measured in the
//! same metric the projection minimises.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! No randomness the caller can see: the draws the reference and the
//! sampling box make come from constant seeds, so the answer is a function
//! of the system, the point and the clearance. No finite differences: the
//! gradients Newton reads are the tape's own reverse sweep, exact, and a
//! constraint without one declines rather than being approximated at a
//! vertex where an approximation is ill-defined. No anchors: nothing the
//! caller has seen elsewhere may influence where a point lands, for the
//! reason above. No brute force *first*: it cannot localise a thin region
//! or a high-dimensional one, and on the cases the projection handles it
//! would re-solve the find-a-first-point problem on every call; it is the
//! last stage, for the cases nothing else can read.
