//! The projection by Newton on the KKT system, over the active set.
//!
//! # The problem, and why it is this easy
//!
//! The nearest feasible point to `p` is `min ½‖u − p‖²` subject to
//! `gᵢ(u) ≤ 0`. At the answer `u*` the KKT conditions hold: `u* − p =
//! −Σ λᵢ ∇gᵢ(u*)` with `λᵢ ≥ 0` for the constraints *active* there and zero
//! for the rest. That is the college question — the shortest distance from a
//! point to a surface is along the surface's normal — in as many dimensions
//! as there are variables. The objective's Hessian is the identity, so the
//! Newton step for the active set `A` is the projection of `p` onto the
//! constraints *linearised* at the current iterate:
//!
//! ```text
//! (J Jᵀ) λ = J (p − uₖ) + g(uₖ)        J = ∇g_A(uₖ), one row per active constraint
//! uₖ₊₁ = p − Jᵀ λ
//! ```
//!
//! — a `|A| × |A|` solve, and `|A|` is a few. On a linear constraint it is
//! exact in one step (the foot of the perpendicular, closed-form); on a
//! curved one it converges linearly, the curvature being the one thing it
//! does not model — see [`NEWTON_ITERATIONS`]. COBYLA, which this replaces
//! where it applies, estimates the same gradients by finite differences
//! dressed as linear models and pays `O(d²m)` per iteration for the
//! privilege.
//!
//! # The active set is a fixed point
//!
//! Which constraints are active at the answer is not known in advance. The
//! guess is the ones the *target* violates — the point being projected, which
//! is also where the iteration starts unless a caller starts it elsewhere; a
//! guess taken at a feasible start would be empty, and the first step would
//! land on the target itself. The solve nominates a
//! point; every constraint is judged there; a newly violated one joins the
//! set and one whose multiplier came out negative — a constraint the
//! projection is pulling *away* from, which at the answer cannot be active —
//! leaves it; and the solve runs again from where it got to. That converges
//! when the nominated point violates nothing off the set and every multiplier
//! is non-negative: the KKT conditions, verified rather than assumed. Bounds
//! are constraints like any other, linear ones with gradient `±eⱼ`, and take
//! part in the set only when violated. So the constraints a gradient is
//! computed for are the few that bite, which is what keeps this cheap on a
//! system of two hundred.
//!
//! # A step stops short of a wall
//!
//! The step is a projection of the target onto the *linearised* constraints,
//! and a linearisation taken where a constraint is well-scaled can send a
//! coordinate straight through a box wall — Keane's `0.75 − ∏xᵢ` from a
//! chord landing, toward a proposal with eleven coordinates at zero, where
//! the product's gradient is exactly zero and the next solve is singular. So
//! a step that would cross a wall is shortened to [`WALL_FRACTION`] of the
//! distance to it and the constraints are linearised again from inside: the
//! offending coordinates fall geometrically toward where the curved
//! constraint actually puts them (3.7e-6 on that proposal) and the full
//! steps that follow converge. The fraction-to-the-boundary rule of
//! interior-point methods, on the box alone. A step that lands exactly *on*
//! a wall is a projection onto it and is not shortened.
//!
//! # Fallible by design
//!
//! Every way this can fail answers `None` and the caller tries something
//! that needs no gradient: a constraint in the active set whose tape has no
//! derivative ([`ConstraintSystem::gradient`] is `None`), a gradient that is
//! not finite at the iterate, a singular or non-finite solve (dependent
//! constraints), a Newton iteration that has not converged in its budget, an
//! active set that has not settled in its. All counts; nothing waits.
//!
//! The landing is *on* the boundary of the active constraints, which by the
//! strict oracle is a hair outside; stepping it inside by the clearance is
//! `repair`'s business, along the direction `p → landing`, which is exactly
//! `−Σ λᵢ ∇gᵢ`, the KKT normal.
