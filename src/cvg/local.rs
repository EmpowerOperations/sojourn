//! A local solve for the search's first point.
//!
//! Finding one feasible point of a nonlinear inequality system is an ordinary
//! constrained optimisation, and a local method eats it: Artemis's SLSQP
//! reaches the stepped beam's optimum from a corner in seconds, where the
//! SMT solver this replaced spent a million resource units per query and
//! brute force cannot find a region a millionth of its box at two hundred
//! variables. This is COBYLA (Powell 1994), derivative-free, with the
//! constraints handled natively by linear models inside a trust region —
//! `basin`'s implementation, pure Rust. It runs after the probe finds
//! nothing and before the box is bisected, so that bisection is reached
//! only when there is nothing to find or pieces to look for.
//!
//! # The objective is the sum of the residuals, and the solve stops at the
//! first feasible point
//!
//! The constraints are COBYLA's to satisfy; the objective only has to give
//! its linear models a slope toward satisfying them from wherever the start
//! is. The sum `Σ g_i(x)` does, everywhere: every coordinate that any
//! constraint names moves it. The worst residual `max_i g_i(x)` — the obvious
//! choice, since descending it is descending toward feasibility — does not:
//! on two hundred bounds `x_i > 10.5` started at the box centre every residual
//! is a hair positive, moving one coordinate fixes one constraint and the
//! maximum does not move, and COBYLA converges on that plateau at a point the
//! oracle rejects, three hundred iterations later. Under the sum the same
//! start lands inside the initial simplex.
//!
//! The solve is not run to any optimum. Every evaluation is a callback of
//! ours, and the moment one is judged feasible the run is stopped: on the
//! stepped beam the first feasible point is evaluation 24 at 100 segments,
//! inside the initial simplex, where converging from there would cost hours,
//! since COBYLA's model algebra grows with the square of the dimension times
//! the constraint count. A seed on the boundary is a seed; the walker's
//! burn-in is what moves away from walls, far more cheaply than the solver.
//!
//! # In the unit cube
//!
//! COBYLA's trust region has one radius for every coordinate, and a box is
//! `[1, 5]` on one coordinate and `[5, 100]` on the next. The solve runs over
//! `u ∈ [0, 1]^d` with `x = lo + u·width`, so a radius means the same on every
//! coordinate of every problem, and the box itself is `2d` more constraints in
//! the same `<= 0` form.
//!
//! # Judged, never trusted
//!
//! Every point the solver evaluates is judged as it goes — the box, every
//! residual `<= 0`, nothing non-finite — and the answer is the judged point
//! with the lowest worst residual seen, never the solver's reported optimum.
//! The one returned is put to [`ConstraintSystem::is_feasible`] once more on
//! the way out, so what leaves here passes the same oracle as every other seed.
//!
//! # Counts, not clocks
//!
//! The starts are the box centre and then draws from the search's seeded rng;
//! each runs for a number of cost evaluations fixed by the dimension. COBYLA
//! is deterministic from a start, so the same seed finds the same point on any
//! machine.
//!
//! # The same solver projects
//!
//! [`nearest`] is the other question a constrained local method answers: the
//! feasible point nearest a given one, `min ‖u − t‖²` over the cube subject
//! to the same rows. It is what `repair` runs where clamping cannot land,
//! from the proposal itself, and it depends on the constraints and nothing
//! else — no anchor, no census, no draw — which is the property an optimizer
//! being repaired needs: the chord it replaced dragged every coordinate
//! toward wherever the census had put points, and steered the optimizer
//! there over thousands of repairs. The objective is squared distance rather
//! than the L1 `repair` reports in, because COBYLA fits linear models and a
//! kink at every axis fights them. Unlike the seed this is run to
//! convergence, since "nearest" is the answer and not "any"; what is kept is
//! still only what was judged, the nearest evaluation with the clearance and
//! the nearest feasible one without it.
//!
//! The rows a projection is given are the constraints **with the clearance
//! built in**: each row is the worst of a constraint's residual at the point
//! and at the point stepped a margin either way along every coordinate the
//! constraint names — the oracle's own neighbourhood, as a number. Without
//! that, a linear constraint defeats the whole thing: COBYLA's steps land
//! exactly on a linear boundary, where a strict comparison's residual is a
//! hair positive, and no evaluation is ever judged feasible. With the margin
//! the boundary COBYLA converges onto is inside the true one by the margin,
//! and what lands there has the clearance with room to spare.
