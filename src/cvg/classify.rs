//! What an equality lets us conclude about the variables it mentions.
//!
//! Babel admits one equality form, `a == b +/- t`, and it covers at least six
//! structurally different problems — the taxonomy is in `docs/todo.md`.
//! Downstream, all six look identical: one residual, satisfied when `<= 0`. This
//! module is what tells them apart.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Not labelling constraints for their own sake. `tests/cvg_equalities.rs`
//! measured the actual defect and it is singular: on a tight equality the pool
//! delivers two hundred *distinct* feasible points spanning `0.0000%` of the
//! free coordinates' range. It finds the feasible set and cannot move along it.
//!
//! So the useful output is not a label, it is a **split**: which coordinates the
//! walker moves, and which it computes from them. Move `x`, evaluate
//! `y = sin(x)`, and a point that was on the curve stays on it — where a chord
//! drawn through both coordinates leaves it almost immediately.
//!
//! # Why this is `cvg`'s and not the front end's
//!
//! `eval` wants a number and has no use for any of this. The front end must not
//! know it either: a rewrite that dropped `y` from the problem would be lying to
//! the evaluator, which still has to compute the residual of the whole
//! constraint. This is a *reading* of the AST, and it changes nothing.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! Rows C (`x2 == x1 + x2/2 - x3/x4`, driven after gathering linear terms) and
//! D (`abs(x1) == 1`, two branches) classify as [`Shape::Opaque`]. They are
//! named in the taxonomy and not yet analysed, and saying so is better than
//! guessing at them. Row E — which variables an under-determined system
//! drives — is [`plans`]'s matching.
//!
//! # A disjunction is several plans
//!
//! `x1 * x2 == 0` is two arms, `x1 = 0` for any `x2` or `x2 = 0` for any `x1`,
//! and a parametrisation describes one arm: drive `x1` and every point lands
//! on the first. So a system keeps **every** plan its matchings admit and
//! chooses among them per point, by [`tightest`]: the plan whose driven
//! coordinates the others pin hardest. On the `x2 = 0` arm at `(0.7, 0)` the
//! slice of `x2` given `x1` is `±t/0.7` where the slice of `x1` given `x2` is
//! the whole box, so "drive `x2`" is that arm's own parametrisation and a
//! chain under it stays on the arm. This keeps a chain where it was seeded;
//! seeding the other arm is the bisection's coverage, which reaches pieces
//! in low dimension and not past a handful. The general answer — a walk in
//! the tangent space of the constraints, projected back by Newton — is
//! recorded in `docs/todo.md` and not built.
//!
//! Row F — `x == sin(x)`, the variable inside and outside a function no solver
//! will take — is [`Shape::Implicit`], and is refused by
//! [`ConstraintSystem::new`](crate::ConstraintSystem::new) rather than
//! searched for. No use case has turned up for `x == f(x)` and Newton is a
//! great deal of machinery to carry for a shape nobody writes. The line is
//! narrower than "self-referential", which would also reject row C and
//! `x^2 == x + 2`; see [`Shape::Implicit`].
