//! HC4-revise over a constraint's tape: what one variable may be if the
//! constraint is to hold, with every other variable at a given interval —
//! and [`slice`], which asks that of every constraint naming a coordinate.
//!
//! The evaluator lowers a constraint to a straight-line tape — its
//! intermediate representation, `eval::tape` — and this runs that tape over
//! intervals, twice. **Forward**, in order, computing every instruction's
//! interval into a slot: what each subexpression *can* be. **Backward**, in
//! reverse, from the requirement that the result be `<= 0` — a constraint
//! tape's result is its residual, and the crate's convention is that a
//! residual at or below zero is the constraint holding — pushing each
//! instruction's requirement onto its operands through the operator's
//! inverse ([`interval::invert_binary`] and friends), intersecting. The
//! requirement that reaches the wanted variable's `Load` is the answer.
//!
//! Every value is computed once and read from its slot: the tape is in single
//! assignment ([`VirtualTape::single_assignment`]), so a slot is one value for
//! the life of a sweep, which is what lets the backward pass read the operand
//! intervals it needs without evaluating anything again. That, and a bitset
//! per slot of the variables it depends on — so the backward sweep skips every
//! instruction that cannot reach the wanted one, which on a sum of two hundred
//! terms is nearly all of them — is the whole of the speed over the tree
//! walk this replaced: 8.5× on that sum, measured, with the same answers.
//!
//! Whole powers arrive as one instruction — the tree is lowered as parsed,
//! where the evaluator unrolls them first (`rewrite::unroll_powers`): `x·x·x`
//! over intervals is wider than `x³`, and a multiplication chain inverts by
//! dividing where a power inverts by its root.
//!
//! The superset rule of [`interval`] holds throughout: an operator with no
//! inverse leaves its operands' requirements at `ENTIRE`, a computed
//! subscript reads as `ENTIRE`, and the answer is a superset of the values
//! that satisfy the constraint — too wide costs a rejected proposal, never a
//! wrong point.
