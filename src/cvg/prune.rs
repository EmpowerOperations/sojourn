//! Interval contraction and bisection: the proof that a region is empty, the
//! constraints to blame for it, and the pieces of a region the walker must be
//! started in.
//!
//! # One mechanism, two jobs
//!
//! [`interval::narrow`] is HC4-revise: given every other symbol's interval,
//! the interval one symbol may take if a constraint is to hold, sound as a
//! superset. The walker asks it from a *point*, one coordinate at a time. Ask
//! it over the declared *box* instead — every constraint, every symbol it
//! names, intersected into the box and repeated until nothing narrows — and
//! that is HC4 propagation, the classical contractor. A coordinate that goes
//! empty is a **proof** that no point satisfies the constraints together,
//! and the constraints that narrowed it are the ones to **blame**.
//!
//! A box that survives is split down its widest coordinate and each half is
//! contracted again. Halves that die are pruned; halves that live are split
//! again, until they are settled, too small to split, or the budget is spent.
//! That is branch-and-prune, and what it leaves is a set of **leaves**: boxes
//! the region may still have a piece in, which is what
//! hit-and-run — unable to cross between pieces — needs to be started in. So
//! the same run that proves a contradiction covers a region in pieces.
//!
//! # What it cannot see
//!
//! Interval arithmetic encloses; it does not decide. A contradiction it
//! misses is one every box encloses a little of: a *thin* one, `x + y <= 1`
//! against `x + y >= 1 + 1e-9`, that bisection reaches only at a width of
//! `1e-9`; or an *algebraic* one, `x*x - 2*x*y + y*y < 0`, whose enclosure
//! holds negatives on every box because the square is never seen as a square.
//! Those end `Live` with the budget spent, and the search reports
//! [`Infeasibility::NotFound`](crate::Infeasibility::NotFound) rather than
//! claiming what it cannot show. A decision procedure would prove them; the
//! one this crate used to link was Z3, and the record of why it left is in
//! `docs/todo.md`.
//!
//! # Blame is the trace, not an analysis
//!
//! Each box carries, per coordinate, the constraints that narrowed it. When a
//! coordinate empties, the blame is the constraint that emptied it, the
//! constraints that narrowed it before, the constraints that narrowed the
//! coordinates *those* read, and so on backwards to a fixpoint — nothing more,
//! and nothing re-run to check. A constraint that narrowed nothing is never
//! blamed. Over a whole run the same trace says which constraints never
//! narrowed anything at all, which is what a `NotFound` names: the ones
//! interval reasoning could conclude nothing from.
//!
//! # Counts, not clocks
//!
//! A contraction ends when no coordinate shrinks by more than [`PROGRESS`] of
//! its declared width or after [`VISITS_PER_CONSTRAINT`] visits per
//! constraint, whichever first; a bisection ends at its budget of
//! contractions. Nothing here waits on anything, so nothing here can hang.
