//! Structured compile-time and run-time diagnostics.
//!
//! # Index naming convention
//!
//! A name ending in **`idx` is zero-based**; a name ending in **`1index` is
//! one-based**. Everything babel reports is zero-based except the `var[i]`
//! subscript, which is one-based in the surface syntax and stays that way.
//!
//! # Thinness
//!
//! ANTLR locates syntax errors; babel's job is to forward them. Every
//! diagnostic the parser emits is reported, verbatim, with source, span, line
//! and column attached — no filtering, no coalescing, no rewording. A parser
//! recovering from a missing paren may well emit several diagnostics for one
//! mistake; deciding which to show a user is the caller's problem, not this
//! module's.
//!
//! Nothing here stores pre-rendered text. [`Display`](std::fmt::Display) builds
//! the human-readable form from the structured data at render time.
