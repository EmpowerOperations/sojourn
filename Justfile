# What running bare `just` does.
default: build

# Formats first. rustfmt is idempotent, needs only a parse, and never changes
# meaning, so it belongs in the loop that runs after every edit rather than in a
# step somebody has to remember. Clippy stays out: its fixes are refactors, and
# it costs a check pass on every build.
#
# Also regenerates the ANTLR lexer and parser: build.rs reruns antlr4-rust-gen
# over grammar/*.g4 whenever a grammar changes.

# nextest rather than `cargo test` so a panic or stack overflow in one test
# doesn't take the rest of the binary with it; the AST is recursive and the
# corpus nests aggregates several deep. nextest does not run doctests, so the
# second line does: the crate-level example is the one a newcomer pastes.
#
# ARGS go to nextest as written: `just test cvg_pools`, `just test --features gpu`.
# A filterset needs quoting twice, once for just and once for pwsh, which
# would otherwise try to run the parentheses: `just test "-E 'test(/repair/)'"`.
